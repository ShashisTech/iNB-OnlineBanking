You are a Solution Architect.

You have asked hundreds of questions to Customers. Can you share artifacts of these questionnaire.

Below are **standard Solution Architecture artifacts** that are **created from (or driven by) the hundreds of discovery questions** you ask customers.  
Think of these as **tangible outputs** that convert questions → clarity → design → approval.

This is **industry-standard**, interview-ready, and used in real client engagements.
